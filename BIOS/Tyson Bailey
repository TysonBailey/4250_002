My name is Tyson Bailey.

Technical Skills:
Some of the languages I know include C#, SQL, HTML, Python, and Java.
I have worked with both Windows and Unix CLIS.

Team Skills:
I have worked with a team on a project multiple times here at ETSU:  
  In CSCI 1210, I worked as part of a five-person team to create a website in HTML based on different card games. We titled it "Arbalest".
  In CSCI 1260, I worked as part of a five-person team to create an RPG in C#.
  In COMM 2055, (Argumentation and Debate), I worked with a four-person team to practice and design a proper debate against one another. 
  In CSCI 3000, I worked as part of a team to create a presentation and do simulated business meetings.
  In CSCI 3700, I was part of a four-person team working with SAP to generate as much profit as possible from a simulated business.
I have done some more minor group assignments as well such as the scavenger hunt assignment in CSCI 1510, and smaller debates in COMM 2055.
While doing these projects, I have run across team members missing meetings, doing very little work, showing a lack of initiative, and other complications, I have always
tried to find the best solutions for these types of people, such as motivating them, assisting them, and or encouraging them to do better as part of the team.

Other notable information:
I have made moderately high grades in every class that teaches C# at ETSU. (Excluding 1250; because Java was the coding language taught in that class at the time.)
I enjoy coding in my free time, I have created many personal projects in C# and Python, most of which to just practice the things I already knew, but I also like to
work on personal projects that expand my knowledge and learn new things along the way.
I am an outgoing person typically, I enjoy presenting and am always open to presenting first to break the ice a bit. I try to be as charismatic and professional as 
possible when presenting.
